# Profile Picture Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Picture

1. **Prepare your image:**
   - Use a square image (recommended: 800x800px or higher)
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Keep file size under 500KB for fast loading

2. **Add your photo:**
   - Save your profile picture as `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png`)
   - Place it in the `assets/images/` folder
   - The website will automatically use your image

3. **Alternative:**
   - If no `profile.jpg` is found, the site will display a placeholder SVG
   - You can customize the placeholder by editing `profile-placeholder.svg`
