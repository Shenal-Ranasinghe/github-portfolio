                        <h3>Devil's Staircase - My First Epic Hike</h3>
                        <p class="story-date">The Backbench Gang | 2023</p>
                        <p>This was my introduction to serious hiking in Sri Lanka's stunning highlands. Together with my high school crew - Shaveen, Dineth, and Chamikara (The Backbench!) - we tackled the legendary Devil's Staircase, one of the most dangerous trails in the world. This famous 14km route features sharp zig-zag twists that are extremely steep and difficult, running from Ohiya's Horton Plains Road through tea estates to Kalupahana on the A4 Main Road.</p>
                        <p>We started at dawn near Bambarakanda Rest, watching the sunrise reflect off the waters of Bambarakanda Falls before beginning our ascent. The trail was challenging - passing by dangerously narrow ridges, traversing the stream that creates Bambarakanda Falls, and hiking through harsh, uneven terrain that truly lived up to its hellish name. We visited a natural pool fed by a clear spring and a Hindu/Buddhist temple along the way. The breathtaking vistas of the valleys to the South and mountains to the North were absolutely worth every difficult step.</p>
                        <p>As we approached the end, we passed through the famous 'V Cut' - a V-shaped channel carved into a hill in ancient times to allow the Devil's Staircase to pass through - and continued through beautiful green tea estates before reaching Ohiya Road near Horton Plains. We also explored Lanka Ella Falls and the majestic Bambarakanda Falls. The highlight? Camping overnight at the Devil's Staircase viewpoint under a blanket of stars, surrounded by misty mountains. Four guys, one tent, endless laughter, and memories that'll last a lifetime.</p>

                        <p class="story-date">High School Gang | 2024</p>
                        <p>Another adventure with the high school crew - this time Dineth, Shaveen, and Achintha joined me for an unforgettable trek to Wangedigala in Kalupahana village. The name "Wangedigala" means pestle, because the peak's shape resembles one. This 3-4 hour hike took us through pine forests, grasslands, and offered amazing views of the surrounding areas including Bambarakanda Falls and Lanka Ella Falls.</p>
                        <p>The climb was challenging - we had to navigate steep mountain slopes covered with pine needles that became slippery, requiring extra precaution. But reaching the top was incredible, with panoramic 360-degree views and a cool climate perfect for the camping spot many hikers use. On the way back, we spontaneously detoured to Nanperial, adding even more adventure to our day. These unplanned moments - stopping by local villages, trying roadside kottu, and taking the scenic route - are what make hiking with friends so special.</p>

                        <p class="story-date">The Backbench | 2024</p>
                        <p>This time, Shaveen, Seyhas, Chamikara, Dineth, and I opted for a different kind of adventure - combining the iconic Sri Lankan train journey with hiking. Idalgashinna is a small town in the Badulla District known for its picturesque tea plantations and cool, hilly climate. The railway station, located in the middle of the Haputale-Namunukula Range at a very high altitude, is a major tourist attraction.</p>
                        <p>What makes this station special? It sits on a steep hillside, and rain water falling on the roof joins the Mahaweli River on one side and the Walawe River on the other! On clear days, you can even see the South Seas from here, and locals say the light of the Dondra Lighthouse is visible at night. We got off at the station and walked along the concrete road, surrounded by an ever-foggy environment with tea plantations and pine groves in every direction. The mountain behind the Ohiya side is popular for night camping. The train journey itself was magical - hanging out of the doorway, feeling the cool mountain breeze through long dark tunnels, and stopping at tiny rural stations. Every hike with these guys becomes a unique story.</p>

                        <p class="story-date">University Friends | 2025</p>
                        <p>Switching things up from high school adventures, this trip was with my university squad, and we went full throttle - literally! We rented bikes and rode through winding mountain roads to reach Madulsima (Madolsima), a picturesque village in the Uva province. The mountain stands at an elevation of 383m, approximately 700-1000m above sea level, with its highest point at Roeberry Estate.</p>
                        <p>There's something incredibly freeing about riding through misty mountain passes, feeling like we're traveling among the clouds. We hiked to the famous Madulsima Mini World's End (also known as Pitamaruwa Mini World's End), which offers spectacular views. The location is mostly shrouded by mist and feels heavenly. The ride back was filled with stops at roadside tea shops and countless photos. University life isn't just about labs and lectures - it's about these spontaneous adventures too!</p>

                        <h3>Haritha Kanda Railway Adventure</h3>
                        <p class="story-date">University Friends | 2025</p>
                        <p>Another train adventure, but this time with my university friends heading to Haritha Kanda. Also known as "Green Mountain", this hiking spot and camping site is situated between Agarapathana and Bopaththalawa plains in the central highlands. The rocky mountain stands at approximately 1800m height, surrounded by lush greenery that provides amazing views - a popular destination among adventure lovers.</p>
                        <p>We took the scenic train journey, hopping off and trekking through the highlands. Haritha Kanda truly lives up to its name - lush green landscapes stretch as far as the eye can see. Standing at the edge at 1800m elevation, looking down at the valleys below and feeling the wind in your face, you realize why Sri Lanka is called the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. These university trips have become a tradition - a way to balance the stress of engineering studies with the peace of nature.</p>
